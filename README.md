# React Native useEffect Cleanup Issue
This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the useEffect hook and asynchronous operations.  The example showcases how failing to properly clean up asynchronous tasks within useEffect can lead to memory leaks and unpredictable behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. 

This is a crucial concept for building robust and efficient React Native applications.
