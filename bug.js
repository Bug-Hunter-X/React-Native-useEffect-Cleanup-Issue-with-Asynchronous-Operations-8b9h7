This React Native code produces an error because of an incorrect usage of the `useEffect` hook. The asynchronous operation inside `useEffect` doesn't properly handle the cleanup function, leading to potential memory leaks and unexpected behavior.  Specifically, the `fetch` call within `useEffect` might not be cancelled when the component unmounts if the component unmounts before the `fetch` completes.
